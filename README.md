#### A Sample game
This video shows a proof of concept game I created to demonstrate my 2D game engine and master's degree final project "A JRPG game platform with the purpose of education and entertainment".  This game was also a humble homage to one of my favorite games of all time, the classic SNES - Chrono Trigger.
